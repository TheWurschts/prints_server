# ðŸ–¼ Photobooth server

This minimal server is used in a photobooth to administer the ongoing event.

You can send pictures to print to server.
The server will push it to the external printer spooler https://github.com/derqurps/cp910_print_spooler
And you can also choose pictures to be reprint from a minimal interface.

If no blank pages to be print on are present in the printer, there can be a pushover message to a person to refill the printer.
